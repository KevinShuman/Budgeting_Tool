# Project Title
Budgeting Tool

## Description
This is a budgeting tool that allows users to track their personal finances. 
The user can add bills, expenses, incomes, bank accounts, and transfers between 
accounts, and the tool will calculate the balances within your bank accounts 
as well as information about how much you spent and earned in for a given amount 
of time. There is certainly room to do more with this tool, though Example.py 
is the way I have envisioned it being used. Feel free to jump on a codespace 
and play around with it!

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Python 3.11.0
### One can find the python dependency libraries in the requirements.txt file.

### Installing
* Clone the repository
* You'll want to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies in. 
You can do this by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
python -m venv <name_you_want_your_env_to_be>
```
* For Linux and Mac OS, activate the virtual environment by running the following 
command in the root directory of the project:
```
source <name_you_want_your_env_to_be>/bin/activate
```
* For Windows, activate the virtual environment by running the following command 
in the root directory of the project:
```
<name_you_want_your_env_to_be>\Scripts\activate.bat
```
* If for some reason Windows does not allow you to run the activate.bat file, you 
can run python commands within the envrionmnet by creating a path to the python.exe 
within the environment:
```
\path\to\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program
* To run the program, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
python Example.py <start date> <end date>
```

### For testing the code
* To run the tests, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
pytest
```
